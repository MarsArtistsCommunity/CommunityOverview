##ABOUT

We can use our imagination as artists to depict our dreams rather than spend weeks laboring at vertices to essentially reproduce the same basic model. Over time we could create a library of high-res Creative Commons models -- UV mapped and textured -- 

Basic models we create now will evolve for commercial use in stereoscopic VR, 3D printed toys and desktop displays, museum and cinematic renderings, games, on and on. Professional commercial studios creating such material could return incrementally improved models to the Creative Commons pool. These free evolving CC models will be of higher quality and available for a wider variety of uses than any single commercial entity could afford to make — including SpaceX.

Importantly they will also be realistic — and depict SpaceX. Rather than suffer through technically illiterate depictions of interplanetary transportation — like The Martian’s Ares — films and games and media of all sorts could use these free basic models. Depicting SpaceX. Making realistic ITP that much more common and intuitive. 

##FAQ

**Can we use the models for commerical work?**
Do whatever you want with them. If you return improved versions that would be helpful. (Just don't sell the original starter models unless you have either updated it significantly or are its original creator.)

**Are artists recognized for their contributions? Can we display models we've improved in our own personal portfolios?**
Sure. Please join the Mars Artists Community and be proud of your contributions here. Even if you've only marginally improved a model others have also contributed to, just note your specfic contributions in your portfolio -- for example with before/after shots.

##TO Do

Start a project or join one and improve a component of the model. For example, if you would like to render the latest ITS model, consider contributing back a portion of the model -- such as its engines, windows, interior, etc -- a little bit improved (with higher-quality textures, higher-res geometry, and so on).

CC0 Use it, abuse it. (We'd appreciate it if you add your own similar models for vehicles, suits, habs and such to help create a permanent open-source repository of resources for depicting human settlement of Mars. After your commercial project, why let your work die on a hard drive? Sell your component models on [Turbosquid](http://turbosquid.com) then drop a copy here for free use by fellow artists ;)
