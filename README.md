##ABOUT
We can use our imagination as artists to depict our dreams rather than spend weeks laboring at vertices to essentially reproduce the same basic model. Over time we could create a library of high-res Creative Commons models -- UV mapped and textured -- 

Basic models we create now will evolve for commercial use in stereoscopic VR, 3D printed toys and desktop displays, museum and cinematic renderings, games, on and on. Professional commercial studios creating such material could return incrementally improved models to the Creative Commons pool. These free evolving CC models will be of higher quality and available for a wider variety of uses than any single commercial entity could afford to make — including SpaceX.

Importantly they will also be realistic — and depict SpaceX. Rather than suffer through technically illiterate depictions of interplanetary transportation — like The Martian’s Ares — films and games and media of all sorts could use these free basic models. Depicting SpaceX. Making realistic ITP that much more common and intuitive. 

##FAQ
**Can we use the models for commercial work?**
Do whatever you want with them. If you return improved versions that would be helpful. (Just don't sell the original starter models unless you have either updated it significantly or are its original creator.)

**Are artists recognized for their contributions? Can we display models we've improved in our own personal portfolios?**
Sure. Please join the Mars Artists Community and be proud of your contributions here. Even if you've only marginally improved a model others have also contributed to, just note your specfic contributions in your portfolio -- for example with before/after shots.

**Can we upload models which were not made in Maya**
Sure. If you do not have access to Maya please consider exporting your work as .obj or .stl file. (Alternatively just upload whatever format is easiest for you...there are many free online file conversion services.) If you would like to learn Maya, Autodesk offers free 30 day trials and student versions here: http://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/maya Excellent free tutorials are available through Autodesk itself and of course on YouTube. (Don't worry too much about learning the entire Maya toolset/workflow...just learn what you need for the immediate task ahead. If you're new, focus on polygon/SubD modeling, then texturing, file referencing, rendering, animation, dynamics, and so on. Do not waste your time learning animation and particle effects before you've created a beautiful complex scene with gorgeous textures -- technology may improve by the time you decide to animate it, if at all.

##To Do
Start a project or join one and improve a component of the team's model. For example, if you would like to render the latest ITS model, consider contributing back a portion of it which you have improved -- such as its engines, windows, interior, or displacement map -- with higher-quality textures and geometry. Hopefully each model will incrementally improve over time -- even allowing components such as windows or engines to be reused in future versions of their real-world counterparts.

##Licenses for All Material on this Site...
CC0 Use it, abuse it. (We'd appreciate it if you add your own similar models for vehicles, suits, habs and such to help create a permanent open-source repository of resources for depicting human settlement of Mars. After your commercial project, why let your work die on a hard drive? Sell your component models on [Turbosquid](http://turbosquid.com) then drop a copy here for free use by fellow artists ;)
